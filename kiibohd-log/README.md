# kiibohd-log

kiibohd-log is a basic log implementation for embedded devices.
It supports multiple transports, which can be enabled at the same time at compile time.

The design of kiibohd-log may change considerably until some of the missing transports are added.


## Usage

See document for examples: TODO
By default no transports are enabled.


## WIP

Still working on the implementation for the following protocols.

- HIDIO
- ITM
- UART
